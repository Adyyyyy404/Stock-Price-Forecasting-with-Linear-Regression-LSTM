# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Forecasting using Linear Regression & LSTM

> A machine learning project that forecasts stock prices using both statistical and deep learning models. Includes SHAP-based model explainability and a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Predicts future stock prices using:
  - Linear Regression (for baseline)
  - LSTM (for capturing temporal dependencies)
- Retrieves real-time stock data using `yfinance`
- Visualizes trends, rolling averages, and model predictions
- Explains model predictions using SHAP values
- Deployable via `Streamlit` web app

---

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, Keras (TensorFlow backend)
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization  
  - `yfinance` for stock data retrieval  
  - `Streamlit` for app deployment  
  - `SHAP` for model explainability
